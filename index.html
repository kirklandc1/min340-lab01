        <p>I don't think I actually have a favorite movie. I love Netflix series'! I recently finished watching Stranger Things, which changed my LIFE. It was amazing! I loved the 80's aesthetic, videography, the characters, and the thrill. I wasn't sure about the characters at first, but the gradual chracter development was so awesome.  </p>

            My favorite book is Blue Like Jazz by Donald Miller. He writes, "nonreligious thoughts on Christian spirituality." He looks at his relationship with Jesus and brings it down with stories from his life, and writes about the special talks with people he's close to, and also people he isn't close to--but that he may have just had an unique encounter with. I love talking to strangers going about every day life, I think that is so important to have different viewpoints from multiple perspectives. Relationships are so important, and connecting with people, and how Donald Miller describes this in his book, and also his hilarity, makes Blue Like Jazz such an awesome read.

            I love to paint! Especially oil paint. I also love the history and the science-y part of oil painting. Some of my favorite artists are Charmaine Olivia and Mary Cassatt. I love to paint people, and their faces, muscles, and expressions. There are so many aspects of painting that I love. There is a certain zone that I go into, and it is such a stress reliever for me to sit down and paint the time away. In the end, you get a product. It doesn't matter whether it is actually beautiful or not, but you can see how the artist portrayed what they were feeling, and I love that about painting! Also I love how, especially in oil painting, you can see the products the artist used, and the brush strokes. My favorite thing is the process of oil painting, and having to paint layer by layer. It tests my patience many times, but the end result is always satisfying.

            My favorite food is probably sushi. Although I haven't been to many different sushi restaurants, but I do adore the sushi at Jungle Jims in Eastgate, Ohio; and also the sushi they serve on campus is wonderful. I love salmon, crab, veggie, and also chicken, they are all so good. I'm pretty sure I crave them all the time. My second favorite food is this Green Curry I get from this restaurant called The Bite. It is in Milford, Ohio. It is a local restaurant, and there is only one of it's kind! I absolutely love this restaurant more than a lot of things. They grow their own fruits and vegatables in the front and back yard of the place. They also get their meat locally, and have chickens in the backyard as well for fresh eggs! It is all organic ad local, and you can taste it in their food. They give you heaping servings of the food and the drinks are in giant mason jars. Just typing about it is making me crave The Bite!
